# Protect Your API
The purpose of this lab is to protect your Blog API routes by adding back end authentication! You should be able to "login" by sending a POST request to a route in Postman. This login should create and send tokens on a successful response. After, you need to be able to protect certain routes on your API by requiring a valid auth token.

# Frontend Under Lock and Token
The purpose of this lab is to protect your frontend components using the auth workflow we coded on the backend. We write a utility file to handle localStorage and extending the use of fetch to more reusable in our applications.
